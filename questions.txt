1. How to integrate crakefile syntax in a common rakefile? Ideal result would be something like this:

driver "scsitmd" do
  ... describe driver here ...
end

task "sign" => scsitmd do
  sh "signtool.exe scsitmd.sys"
end

task "upload" => "sign" do
  File.copy "scsitmd.sys" $UPLOAD_DIR
end

2. How to implement an analog of make's late-binding variables? Use case:

configuration "common_cfg" do
  out_dir "build/#{@name}/#{@config[:target_arch]}"
end

library "cmnlib", :config => "common_cfg" do
  ... name is defined here as "cmnlib", but after "common_cfg" is created
  target_arch :x86_64
end

The problem is that by the time target architecture and project name are defined, out_dir has already been evaluated.
Ideally, the string passed to out_dir should be evaluated/constructed at the time it is really needed, which is after
the project has been fully defined.
